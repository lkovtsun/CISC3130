	This program reads the csv file with third party library "opencsv" using maven to implement the library. This library 
discards the problem with possible commas in the name of songs. 
	
	The program reads only names for now and as it does it counts how manny the artist appeared in the top list.
It does not write name twise to the array, it first searches for same string in the array. If it does not find then name is added
the array with a count 1. If program does find the name in the array then counter is increased by 1. Then it prints names and
counters that are in the array to the output.txt file. Afterwards it assembles a linked list of artist objects using the names
from the array. Later sorts it using implemetation of insertion sort. After the list is alphabeticaly sorted, the program prints
the list.
